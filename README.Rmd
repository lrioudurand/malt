This package implements the sampling algorithm: Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Trajectories (Riou-Durand and Vogrinc 2022). Details available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13230). The MALT algorithm is a robust extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, for which robustness of tuning is enabled by a positive choice of damping parameter (a.k.a friction).

## Installation

You can install the development version of malt from [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) with:

``` r
# Enable repository from lrioudurand
options(repos = c(
  lrioudurand = 'https://lrioudurand.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install malt in R
install.packages('malt')
